# Linear and integer programming problems with Lingo and Gusek

Posing and solving three optimization problems:

- The first problem deals with profit maximization in an agricultural production plan with limited land and water. The basic syntax for defining variables and constraints is shown.

- The second problem deals with profit maximization for a household appliance company that manufactures washing machines. More complex structures and external data loading are shown.

- The third problem deals with the determination of the media to be used by a company to advertise its product maximizing its reach within a budget. Here, integer and binary variables are used.

In each folder, the problem statement (**.txt** file), the code of the model (**.lg4** file in Lingo or **.mod** file in Gusek), its solution (**.lgr** file in Lingo or **.out** file in Gusek) and an explanation of the results (**.pdf** file) are shown.
