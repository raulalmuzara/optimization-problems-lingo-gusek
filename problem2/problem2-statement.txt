Problem 2 - Linear programming with Gusek: Loading external data and using more complex structures


A manufacturer of household appliances produces four models of washing machines W4, W5, W40 and W50.

These appliances consist mainly of a metal drum, covered with a sheet metal casing, which is rotated by an electric motor,
and an electric programmer is used to control the operation of the washing machines.

The W4 and W40 models have a lower load capacity (4 kg), requiring 5 m2 of sheet metal,
while the W5 and W50 models are slightly larger (5 kg), requiring 8.5 m2 of sheet metal.
The available quantity of sheet metal is 10,000 m2.

The W4 and W5 models have a motor called M1 and a programmer called P1. The W40 and W50 models have an M2 motor and a P2 type programmer.
The M1 motor is less powerful than the M2 and the P1 programmer has fewer options than the P2 programmer.
The material required to manufacture the motors can be obtained with virtually no limitations.

The motors are assembled in an assembly unit with a working capacity of 3,000 hours,
1 hour being necessary to assemble an M1 motor and 1.5 hours to assemble an M2 motor.

As for the programmers, they can either be manufactured in-house in a section of the assembly plant,
or they can be ordered from an electronics manufacturer.
In the first case, they compete with motor assembly (the motor manufacturing process takes hours of assembly in the assembly unit),
requiring 0.3 hours to manufacture P1 at a cost of 6 euros and 0.75 hours to manufacture P2 at a cost of 11 euros.
In the second case, the supplier can provide any quantity of P1 and P2 at a price of 11 and 21 euros, respectively.

Finally, the washing machines are assembled in another finishing unit with a capacity of 5,000 working hours,
requiring 1.5 hours for the W4 model, 2.3 hours for the W5 model, 3 hours for the W40 model and 4.2 hours for the W50 model.

In order to satisfy all sectors, the manufacturer has decided that the minimum production of each model should be 300 units.

As an additional fact, it is known, according to a report from the marketing department,
that the demand for the higher capacity models is always higher than the demand for the lower capacity models.
Therefore, the combined production of W5 and W50 must be higher than the combined production of W4 and W40.

The profit provided by each model excluding labor and materials, except the programmer,
is 96 euros for the W4 model, 102 euros for the W5 model, 108 euros for the W40 model and 147 euros for the W50 model.

Pose and solve a linear programming model for the production planning of washing machines aiming at profit maximization.
