Problem 1 - Linear programming with Lingo and Gusek: Basic construction of models.


An agricultural association has two plots. Plot P1 has 400 hectares of usable land and 500 m3 of water,
while plot P2 has 900 hectares of usable land and 1200 m3 of water.

The recommended crops are beet and cotton.

Beet consumes 3 m3 of water per hectare, with a profit of 700 monetary units per hectare.

Cotton consumes 2 m3 of water per hectare, with a profit of 500 monetary units per hectare.

A maximum production portion has been established for each crop equal to 800 hectares for beet and 600 hectares for cotton,
and the total percentage of cultivated land must be the same in each of the two plots (if 40% is cultivated in P1 then also 40% in P2).

Pose and solve the problem that allows to determine the production plan that maximizes profit.
